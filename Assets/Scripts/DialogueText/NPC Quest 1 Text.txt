Hey there! I'm in desperate need of help!
I was wandering around the 'Forest of Wolves' and I stumbled upon this mysterious dungeon.
I freaked out when I saw these bright red eyes moving in the shadows and I lost my necklace.
Could you please go there, find it, and bring it back to me. I will make sure to pay you gold as compensation for the troubles.
Please help me, thank you!


Wow you did it!
Thank you so much!
Here, for your troubles.
'You earned 50 gold'.
