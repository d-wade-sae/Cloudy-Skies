There are two ways that you can gain items.
The first method is to fight monster, by doing so upon winning the battle there is a chance that it will drop loot. 
This applies to enemies in open fields and dungeons that said there will always be a guaranteed drop of gold.
The second method is to spend your gold at the 'Blacksmith' shop here in the 'Central Hub'. There you can
buy or sell weapons, armours and misc. items.
The others will have more information for you.
